    <h1>Takoradi, Ghana</h1>
    <p>Takoradi rests along the cost of south-eastern Ghana along with its sister: Takoradi. The city, like most of the
        coast, was colonised by the dutch and Brittain with castles from both still standing today along the coast.</p>

    <p>Since 1946, Takoradi and Sekondi have thrived as a single municipality, but Takoradi became the cultural
        reference for the area. It has a mixture of beach and hilly terrain with new and old buildings throughout.
        Depite not having an international airport, a local one is established in the area as well as reduced rail
        service and sea travel.</p>
