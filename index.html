            <p>
                I am a Star Wars fan and Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast without
                any money to go with it. I am 26 years old with a beautiful wife
                and yes this may be an old picture but it still pretty much looks
                like me.

            <p>Florida, known as the Sunshine State, is almost entirely made up of coastline bordering both the Gulf of
                Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. It also is one of the main launching sites for NASA and other operations.
