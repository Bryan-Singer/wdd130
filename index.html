            I am a Star Wars fan and Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast without
            any money to go with it. I am 26 years old with a beautiful wife
            and yes this may be an old picture but it still pretty much looks
            like me.

            Florida was the 27th State to enter the Union in 1845. It stands as
             the "most populous of the southeastern states and the second most 
            populous Southern state after Texas," according to Britannica. It 
            is home to the best Disney - World, has the honor of being my 
            birthplace, and is exactly as humid as I like it to be year round.
